# Engineering_Flashcards
This is a basic front-end only Javascript flashcard app. The class "Card" only has two attributes "front", and "back". The cards are put into arrays then iterated through by switches. There are currently 3 options, electronics, thermodynamics and physics. Each option has an event listener that starts and iterates through the appropriate switch/flashcard deck when clicked. After the deck is finished there is an option to repeat. If no is selected the original options are displayed. I'm aware of the bug in the app. The right (or wrong) combination of yes's and no's selected causes multiple arrows to be displayed, each activating cards from their own deck. I'm currently troubleshooting the same. I beg the forgiveness of any actual engineers for any mistakes in actual content. Pretty much all the terms come from "Thermodynamics" and "Electronics" "For Dummies"...not an engineer just a book nerd LOL.
